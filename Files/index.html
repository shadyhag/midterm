        <p class="main">Philadelphia has the highest percentage of bicycle commuters than any other city in the nation, but its yearly rate of
          bike lane additions pales in comparison with other major cities.
        </p>
        <h2 class = "graphtitle">Annual Average Miles of Bike Lanes Added
          <br>2008-2013 </br> </h2>
          <canvas id="myChart1" width="280" height="280"></canvas>
          <p class="main">
            Most bike lanes are added when the roads get repaved. In 2013 and 2014, Philadelphia only repaved fifty miles of its roads at a rate of twenty-five
            miles per year. This is much less than what a city should actually be repaving, which is around 140-150 miles per year.
          </p>
          <p class="main">
            This backlog and consequently the rate of bike lane additions result in little funding allocated to street improvements. Since the City of Philadelphia
            is severely restricted in its funding for street improvements, great care should be taken in deciding where and what kind of bike lanes the City
            should add to increase bike infrastructure investments.

          </p>
          <p class="main">The following slides look at four different characteristics of the City's streets in order to filter out the street that
            should be at the top of the list in new bike infrastructure. </p>

              <p class="main">The first step in deciding which street should should be at the top of the list in
                adding new bike infrastructure is to look at Philadelphia's exiting Bicycle Infrastructure.

              </p>
              <p class="main">
                Currently there are six different types of bike lanes and they are scattered and in disconnected throughout the city, but mostly concentrated
                around Center and University City. The next slide will look at the connectivity and mobility of the bike lanes in the two aforementioned areas.

            </div>
            <p class="main">Optimizing network connectivity should begin in finding streets missing segments of bike infrastructure in Center and University Cities,
              where bike infrastructure is at its densest. Fragmented bike infrastructure forces bicyclists to share the road with cars and make it difficult to bicyclists
              to travel to their destination in the shortest and easiest way possible.
            </p>
            <p class="main">
              Those streets were further narrowed down by their widths. To accomodate bike lanes, street widths must be at least 24 feet wide.
              Taking all of this into consideration the number of potential streets decreased from 274 down to the following six:
              5th Street, 20th Street, Chestnut Street, John F Kennedy Street, Market Street, and Spring Garden.

            <p>Knowing which streets bicyclists travel most on will provide information on which of these six corridors are in highest demand of
              additional bike infrastructure. DVRPC provides a dataset of 8,340 trips made from May 2014 to October 2014. This dataset was updated by
              bicycle users logging their trips based on their geospatial location.
              This provides insight on where which streets bicyclists prefer the most to travel.
            </p>
            <p> The top two corridors of the six in question that had the highest number of trips were on 5th Street and 20th Street. </p>

            <p>The last filter looked at which corridor had the highest number of bicycle accidents. This was based on the 2008-2012
              Philadelphia traffic incidents shapefile obtained from the City of Philadelphia selecting only bicycle incidents along 5th Street and 20th Street.
               There were a total of 53 bicycle incidents along 20th Street and 30 bicycle incidents along 5th Street. Based on this analysis it can be concluded
               that 20th Street is more dangerous for bicyclists than 5th Street, and more care should be made to improve bicycle safety along this corridor.

            <p>Although a greater number of trips were made on 5th Street as opposed to 20th Street, the corridor that should be at the top of the
              priority list of bicycle infrastructure improvements should be 20th Street as it would make it safer for bicyclists to share the road with vehicles.
